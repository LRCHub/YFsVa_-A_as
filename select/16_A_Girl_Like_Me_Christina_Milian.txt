You know like I know
You ain't never ever met nobody like me, me
You know like I know
You ain't never ever met nobody like me, me

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

I might wake you up in the morning and cook for you
If you having problem with a song I'll write a hook for you
11: 30 at night I ain't gonna look for you, look for you
'Cause I know you coming home with me

I will never stress you or make you feel misled
If you wanna go to the movies I'll flip it instead
You don't pay for me, I get this with my bread, my bread
'Cause you know my money ain't a thang, a thang

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

Now, if you trying to be out to the party I'll let you go
If you wanna be out with somebody that's when I'll show
You do as you please 'cause baby that's how you know that
There's no other place I'd rather go

I ain't trying to be fussin' and fightin' up on yo' back
Anytime you need me you know I'm getting yo' back
Ain't no one like me I want you to know that, know that
I ain't changing nothing 'cause it's like that, like that

I know you're used to lovers that treat you like your mother
So I know it's hard to understand when I say
I'm your girl but I'm like your man

No matter if it's sweet talk or street talk
I'm right here by your side and soon you'll come to see
How it is to be down with a chick like me

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

You ain't never gotta worry about me shaking the spot
Or ever think about another chick taking your spot
I love it when you come around shuttin' shot down
Lookin' good statin' in my SUV

You know how long I've been waiting
For someone with they mind right
Find they like to kick it with this homie in the limelight
Don't play uh uh keep a havin' fun, all she ever think about is me

Christiana, I ain't never seen nobody do it like you
That's why I'm out here tryin' to give the whole world to you
No matter what it is, I gotta get it hers and his
'Cause baby you're the girl of my dreams

At first I didn't understand what I was dealing with
A real real fly relationship I was killing it
But now I never felt nothing like I'm feeling this
And all I ever talk about is getting that ring

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat you other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down little chick on ya team
