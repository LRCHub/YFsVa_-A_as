Heathen, I could give you something to believe in
But this love's fulfilling reputation
Talking like you're God's favorite creation

Nothing makes you smaller, than being a big man
You'll be my revolver, I got you in my hands
Almost looking taller when I'm leading in the dance
Uh-oh, have you never let a woman do that?

You've never met a girl like me before
Never met a girl like, never mеt a girl like
I'd give you just a taste but you'd want morе
Never met a girl like, never met a girl like

Never met a girl like, never met a girl like
Never met a girl like, never met a girl like

Handsome, there ain't nothing sexy 'bout a tantrum
And I'm not even here I'm just a phantom
I know I'm putting you on the spot
What do you think, you're ready or not?
Pa-ra-pa-ra, probably not

Nothing makes you smaller, than being a big man
You'll be my revolver, I got you in my hands
Almost looking taller when I'm leading in the dance
Uh-o, have you never let a woman do that?

You've never met a girl like me before
Never met a girl like, never mеt a girl like
I'd give you just a taste but you'd want morе
Never met a girl like, never met a girl like

I want you down boy, down on the floor
I'll show you things you've not explored

You've never met a girl like me before
Never met a girl like, never mеt a girl like

Never met a girl like, never met a girl like
Never met a girl like, never met a girl like me
