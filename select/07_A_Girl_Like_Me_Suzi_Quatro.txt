A man like you
A girl like me
We don't watch the meter
We can park for free
Why do I want you alone tonight
Why do I want you, alone every night
Baby baby I know what you need
You need two strong arms and a girl like me
Baby baby I know what you want
You want everything
And a girl like me
A girl like me
I can make it easy
I can make it right
And if you call me now
We can make it all night
When you come near me
When you come close
You make my knees weak my body shake
I can feel it baby coast to coast
That's why I want you alone tonight
That's why I want you alone most every night
A man like you
And a girl like me
We don't watch the meter
We can park of free
A man like you
And a girl like me
We don't watch the meter
We're just so hard to please
Why do I want you alone at night
Why do I want you alone most every night
